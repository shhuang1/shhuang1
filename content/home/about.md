# About me

I am an assistant professor in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology at New York University.  I earned a doctorate in computational and systems biology with focus on both "dry"- and "wet"-lab genomics methods. My research aims to make innovative use of computational methods and high-throughput technologies to advance knowledge of gene regulation at the systems level. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how the repertoire of molecular variations at the levels of individual and population give rise to phenotypic variations in realistic environment.  Using plants as a model, my lab investigates three topics related to stress responses:

- genetic and epigenetic determinants for stress response traits in natural populations of one species;
- single cell methods for characterization of cell type specific responses;
- population and cell-type specific regulatory networks for stress response.
