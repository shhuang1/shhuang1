# About the lab

We are in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology at New York University.  Our research uses both both "dry"- and "wet"-lab genomics methods to advance knowledge of gene regulation at the systems level for both plants and humans.  Specifically, we are interested in understanding how the repertoire of molecular variations at the levels of individual and population give rise to phenotypic variations in realistic environment.  Using plants as a model, we investigate three topics related to responses to the environment:

- genetic and epigenetic determinants for stress response traits in natural populations of one species;
- single cell methods for characterization of cell type specific responses;
- population and cell-type specific regulatory networks for stress response.
